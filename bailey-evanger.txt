Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        inline elements do not force a new line to begin, while block elements typically create a line break.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        By adding up the different elements (margin,padding, border) and making them all equal the total width you want.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        display block: div, p, header. display inline: span, a. display inline-block: img.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        the box model is a model that shows how every html element has multiple boxes that wrap around it. Those boxes start with the margin as the box on the outside. then border, then padding and then inside padding is the content. This shows how margin, border and padding all relate to each other. You can fix the box model by calculating all of the elements so that they add up to what you want them to.
